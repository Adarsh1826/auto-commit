# 💚 Auto Commit — Because Green Squares > Real Work

## 🚀 What Is This?

A script that **commits automatically** to make your GitHub profile look *alive and productive*,  
even if all you did was sip coffee and stare at your screen.

Because let’s be honest —  
GitHub doesn’t care *what* you commit,  
it just loves **activity**. 🌱

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. Script runs automatically.  
2. Commits something meaningless.  
3. Pushes to GitHub.  
4. You get those sexy green squares.  
5. World thinks you’re a workaholic genius. 💼

## 💅 Why Use This?

- That contribution graph won’t fill itself.  
- “Last commit 14 days ago” = developer depression.  
- Recruiters love green more than money.  
- Consistency is key (even if it’s fake consistency).  
- Because it’s hilarious.
